### CPSC 120

* Lab 1 

 Lab 1 holds a special place for me as it marks the beginning of my journey into programming. Writing a simple program to print my partern name felt like taking the first step into the vast world of coding. Even though it's a basic program, it represents the foundation on which I built my understanding of C++. 

* Lab 6 Part 2

This lab holds a special place in my coding journey because it introduced me to the exciting world of game logic and scoring mechanisms. Crafting functions to determine the score of a two-card blackjack hand was not just about writing code; it was about translating the rules of a classic card game into a functional and efficient program.

* Lab 10 Part 1

This lab holds a special place in my coding journey because it beautifully combines the elegance of prime numbers with the intriguing concept of reversing digits. The challenge of checking whether both a number and its reverse are prime required a thoughtful implementation of both prime-checking logic and string manipulation.
